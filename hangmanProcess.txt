OBJECTIVE:

This program will alow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of words from a text file.
-Make a funtion that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
-Make a function that takes imput from the user which will be the letter guessed
-Make a function that will take the letteres guessed correctly and turn them into a string
-Need to create varous variables to store the users imputted data
    -variable for the word that the computer picks
    -create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed right by the user
-Need to display an intro to the program
-Build a repetitive system , so that the user can keep guessing letters
-If the user guesses wrong, a new part of the body is drawn, until they lose. (Guesses left goes down and wrong guesses go up)
-Add statements at the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
